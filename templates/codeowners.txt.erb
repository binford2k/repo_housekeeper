Hi there!

We've transitioned to the use of CODEOWNERS files in all our public GitHub
repositories. Not only does this help document who's responsible for the code
you're looking at, but it will automatically issue PR review requests for the
parts of the codebase that a PR changes.

This report helps to keep these files current, maintained, and correct. The most
common issues we see are malformed owner assignments and incomplete coverage.
The owners assignment should be '@puppetlabs/<team name>'. We prefer team
assignments, but you can also use an individual assignment if needed as long as
you make sure to keep it current. To ensure complete code coverage, we recommend
that you place a wildcard match (such as '* @puppetlabs/community-maintainers')
as your first rule in the CODEOWNERS file.

Public repositories without CODEOWNERS files:
-----------------------------------------------
<% missing.each do |repo| -%>
* <%= repo[:html_url] %>
    * <%= repo[:description] %>
<% end -%>

Public repos with malformed CODEOWNERS:
-----------------------------------------------
<% malformed.each do |repo| -%>
* <%= repo[:html_url] %>
    * <%= repo[:description] %>
<% repo[:codeowner_errors].each do |error| -%>
    * <%= error %>
<% end -%>
<% end -%>

Public repos with incomplete codepath coverage:
-----------------------------------------------
<% coverage.each do |repo| -%>
* <%= repo[:html_url] %>
    * <%= repo[:description] %>
<% end -%>

Public repos with codepaths owned by users:
-----------------------------------------------
<% userowned.each do |repo| -%>
* <%= repo[:html_url] %>
    * <%= repo[:description] %>
    * Users: <%= repo[:codeowner_users].join(', ') %>
<% end -%>
