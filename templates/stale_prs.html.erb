<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>Following is a sample of some GitHub pull requests that could use some love.
It would really help a ton if you'd help us out and clean up what you can. It's
easier than you think:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, check to see if the repository is even maintained anymore.
    Can it just be archived or deleted? See these <a
    href="https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/OSP/End+of+Maintenance+proposal">end-of-life
    suggestions</a>.</li>
  <li>Is there a <code>CODEOWNERS</code> file to help identify its owners?</li>
  <li>Is the pull request even relevant? If not, simply close it with some wording following
    <a href="https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=208736674">this guidance</a>.</li>
  <li>Finally, review the PR. Can it be merged? Does it need work? Can you request a review from a subject matter expert?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for your help! If you'd like to dig into some more issues, you'll find the full list with
  <a href="https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+user%3Apuppetlabs+archived%3Afalse+sort%3Acreated-asc">a quick GitHub search</a>.
