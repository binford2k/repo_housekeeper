Hi there!

Following is a sample of some GitHub pull requests that could use some love. It
would really help a ton if you'd help us out and clean up what you can. It's
easier than you think:

First, check to see if the repository is even maintained anymore. Can
it just be archived or deleted? See the end-of-life suggestions below:
    * https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/OSP/End+of+Maintenance+proposal

Is there a CODEOWNERS file to help identify its owners?

Is the pull request even relevant? If not, simply close it with some wording
following this guidance:
    * https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=208736674

Finally, review the PR. Can it be merged? Does it need work? Can you request a
review from a subject matter expert?

Thanks for your help! If you'd like to dig into some more issues, you'll find the
full list at:
